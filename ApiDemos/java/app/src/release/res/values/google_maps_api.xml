    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    See this page for more information:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get_an_android_certificate_and_the_google_maps_api_key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    Note: This resource is used for the release build target. You likely only want to update the string
    in the debug/.../google_maps_api.xml instead if you just want to run this app.
    (This file is used for the release target that uses the release key store.)
